sophisticated 
up comic also few 
also mostly smith's own fellow 
hilarious wrong 
kevin better he'll first 
also as so heavy-handed 
great instead 
true overrated amy true as well 
not smith's bad 
god's superior 
basically bad 
virtually impossible special also best like not 
not exactly new i no old particularly smith's 
smith's own over like 
smith's simplistic such adult as bible correctly there even correctly 
alan fallen ben 
along way thirteenth rufus salma jay silent kevin 
fallen lee all 
logical convoluted only as smith's little dramatic 
supposedly outrageous black bible racist white 
kevin not necessarily 

as much amusing 
before then 
film's uneven 
very funny as kind 
many film's just as virtually salma 
also away
