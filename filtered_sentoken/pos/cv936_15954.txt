it's tough really nice about who's so once now american i 
not only human out kind who's not wisely off 
subject blind up 
he's then brilliant political eerie 
he's so utterly convincing as public so as actually through 
he's edward norton so much he's almost as convincing public as first he's clean black on left he's black outside white never out doesn't 
so he's willing even mean only 
 american about black namely same 
all as smart vicious correct he's before all all 
that's 
film's danny edward perpetually about also now principal i just out on deep correct 
danny just on on nowhere 
coincidentally he's not as full 
he's just as intelligent still very rough along he's up 
he's no longer danny who's before up 
danny won't 
large then as as ago 
around then off all black white 
mostly prime as vicious on local no longer white easily illegal same off on illegal on 
white fuzzy not only intelligently up political 
enough much true 
 american really great rather great effortlessly next 
there best all 
jewish quietly final 
traditional macho nice black 
actually black final so nasty shocking all 
there's much like acting uniformly good beverly as horrible other off best he's like really long 
norton off though off such not adequate 
only fifth norton as reliable intense maybe best 
there's like norton really out such all off similar young 
little through amazing 
sadly enough isn't great perhaps 
it's too even little contrived really off as either powerful emotional 
especially other just so emotional 
mere kevin regular ethan rather as fat even dramatic isn't as well 
danny never really inevitable doesn't like actually there 
even doesn't 
though william don't i black even before intelligently there never real back so intense about 
as such tony 

 american very good i very better as not up potential 
somewhere there tony true norton then thus 
alan once not really that's no really good alan 
right it's not up even he's not normal rather own personal 
not right late 
yet still intelligently up so one's own literally over unfortunately 
even isn't perfect norton he's better not only also
