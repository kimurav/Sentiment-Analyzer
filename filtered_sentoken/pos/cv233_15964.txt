 bug's not it's close antz 
i really antz basically because yes clever witty intelligent woody allen lead perhaps year's inspired there i'm first 
maybe it's never totally off real innocent fun it's too obsessed totally engaging woody allen just really clever 
 bug's similar also it's not totally over like antz not bad also that's completely innocent even it's also perpetually clever 
 antz still witty i bug's general it's also entertaining 
really really whole new never before it's on better antz 
it's also light clever 
instead bright still amazing visual antz worthy 
also nicely though broad still contemporary animated 
lead dave neurotic antz nearly as engaging as allen instead much menacing kevin spacey as lead 
romantic lead don't spacey intelligent doesn't even around very final 
not really better antz it's basically yet giant else 
accidentally all away so won't up 
unbeknownst similar false 
equally wonderful slim david joe male pretentious jonathan harris michael 
lightly on bug's away wild visual 
like menacing 
small ominous mortal usual 
modern-day complete as on out next off 
like giant acting like small 
around several large like halfway through as wild entertaining as wonderfully exciting chase through small 
meanwhile completely interesting antz couldn't over bug's it's final out antz incessantly hilarious just right final left full worth 
still it's no 
maybe above animated ever almost true 
didn't about it's really it's visually striking animated thus far still satisfying perfect innocent fun 
yet bug's as well as antz still amazing you're animated they're not same
