like wonderful robert de first inspired true inspired true oliver 
so very good top first not quite as strong not as sure as still intelligent 
as amy new off 
long as up handsome only out later actually blind 
amy doesn't really not finally 
once new amy on certain out even though there only similar 
first reluctant finally amy much overbearing loving kelly 
ultimately never visually before only 
eager on 
on overall first indeed many before great 
also easily 
however first above mature intelligent amy 
usually romantic shameless recent immediately i about 
off well as amy up north first 
strangely erotic maybe even so later actual as romantic quickly entertaining sweet there clearly 
early on out well later seriously due always known completely blind peaceful big 
other major nearly flawless 
usually macho always believable as blind probably little tricky 
up not off as off 
spectacular hilarious woody allen mighty as ditzy here 
mediocre then mimic always out first finally 
climactic gifted young around comedic dramatic 
kelly easily off as bad one-dimensional instead also unexpectedly as overly simply 
finally usually little too over-the-top appropriately restrained as 
first medical on 
very little ever so impossible 
perhaps not afraid gross out i personally even graphic over simply cold 
far 
because strong steve way main because fabulous film's few over 
adult way no real-life inspired still together many even though new 
usually known as bad first as refreshing sophisticated
