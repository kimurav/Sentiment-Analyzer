truman paramount ed harris long dramatic finally big 
asleep last few on truman seemingly idyllic beautiful 
so perfect however because it's harris truman unwittingly 
that's right live american public all it's massive sound 
too far 
so different easy dumb down common 
luckily sensible enough all yet never dumb 
he's perfect best 
completely 
occasionally silly generally 
he's not completely dramatic like however 
ed harris extreme 
quiet well 
unfortunately he's barely first all 
also disappointing 
well sadly underwritten just 
supporting excellent delightfully perfect so perfect it's creepy 
also superb great 
clearly fun 
far upbeat previous dead green 
slightly slow about half really up fully on 
sadly though practically over full 
also slightly too ambiguous disappointing 
entertaining 
truman increasingly silly never over easy 
also there's funny 
overall truman excellent 
certainly different usual 
almost certainly not out disappointed 
overall
