phantom 

few like george classic 
original not only deeply american 
arguably 
so original third new 
new new possibly first luke cultural 
fourth phantom last 
early critical major neither 
phantom certainly not nonetheless engaging exciting visually breathtaking 
worthy original 
phantom before original 
as obi-wan wise old luke original only young still fellow qui-gon 

quickly not middle young 
later eventually forced before 
on qui-gon young not only uncanny 
qui-gon unusually strong 
as original far ruthless 
further mysterious behind out lethal 
soon also deadly relentless 
complicated 
phantom not only earlier immediate up eventually lead evil dark original 
not overwhelming 
quickly only many predictably unanswered next 
film's not too confusing too 
it's unclear phantom 
original clearly around 
it's unclear new 
on it's shaky 
like many subtle acting adult as shallow 
on dark so special qui-gon willing 
fine though often 
perfect as 
as obi-wan calm 
young well often very little much 
phantom not 
new no original not confusing previous 
previous doesn't as good off 
there immediate memorable luke obi-wan luke 
ensemble off other immediately distinct 
luke on about all immediate other 
there no phantom out other 
interesting clear little 
perhaps probably disappointed many 
still very engaging 
many wonderful previous phantom memorable entertaining 
first remarkably rich imaginative 
magical underwater menacing on spectacular on then gothic urban 
elaborate complex 
never vague about rich spectacular 
new special special earlier just possible 
ever new supporting main 
best such greedy as 
italian short oddly like as around 
all computer-generated best enjoyable 
computer-generated no phantom complete controversial 
george fully computer-generated new 
clumsy literally way early 
usually out 
nearly seamless as really on 
however magic possible isn't completely convincing 
still too much like 
never 
he's there never animated 
initially i annoying 
on second fun i didn't all 
second fine small out 
all film's good evil sober about one's like all phantom never too seriously 
fortunately hasn't lost not high 
film's 
phantom simply fun easily 
finally phantom because as all there no 
there good evil 
on entertaining exciting final obi-wan qui-gon arguably best 
phantom won't major 
probably won't 
it's not even best i'd third original back 
it's exciting entertaining far better typical 
live up it's no not even original 
it's still worth 
probably once
