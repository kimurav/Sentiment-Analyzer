oliver critical 
out recent not though exaggerated very 
as mythical good evil fast-paced 
contemporary classic 
i'm proud i never as 
i just as as thin obvious young 
same nearly all 
good 
typical as 
it's all up false rather really like 
i psychologically manipulative as rather laughably over top 
all not 
i so many 
only possible i 
not just good subject down glamorous way through inane high low 
forever as not only bad bad bad bad 
maybe special as welcome 
equally 
though much subtle touching 
concerned yet akin big rather heartless 
as well though doesn't 
about 
as i indeed timely prime about prime hasn't quite not only other 
all 
seth all easy way 
he's out kind just like 
ben as commanding like 
enthusiastic 
it's ironic same they're out 
obviously similar 
just like baldwin 
brutal as own 
simply as really 
like on way big 
on effectively intellectual 
aren't above as especially all too eager minor 
up along seth just like

well like junior david 
just tightly 

like psychological tense isn't aware 
brief truly exceptional 
edgy extremely potent here pale eerie all worth 
aren't way he's 
well confident it's just front 
thankfully slowly like intelligent psychological 
seth kind 
minor 
i sci-fi black completely different equally effective 
kind arnold 80's kind 70's 
nicky also memorable as superior obsessed 
long as lone black many white first as as talented interesting 
oddly likeable 
long smart 
i'm just 
it's terrible such innocuous way 
unfortunately 
there much 
okay small as other 
particular on poor 
it's not bad on further out 
bad 
yes it's obvious i haven't much 
all simplistic 
neither extreme
