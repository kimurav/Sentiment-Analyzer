woody terribly boring just closely personal favorite personal favorite all 
woody almost never on visual over so closely really ever beautiful black white best 
up usual plain white over black old ironic standard on then gorgeous dull gray 
on 
it's all rather lovely 
then as film's hilariously banal key lead as beautiful as ever wrong whatever 
it's terribly stale woody allen great i soon once again new not as great as past though last year's harry awfully close 

once on neurotic not funny insightful like together out 
 over though wonderful on just never totally off 
 mighty full great really great 
 i great great 
even harry cheap way even top as truly hilarious 
allen off it's not wrong about wonderful it's 
 yes good it's only marginally satisfying as woody allen 
instead great woody allen he's out subject only about 
he's almost entirely on so like minor 
it's like right correct personal 
woody old woody allen on then all up not kenneth lead 
much about dead on irritating real actually woody allen though same hardly 
along little woody allen actually apparent 
flawed anyway because he's really funny really witty really intelligent 
allen bad same so yes like we're still not sure he's really good not 
lee simon first on aforementioned on extra then off 
then through lee high 
as so maybe deep personal 
as such several allen regular on sexual over 
perverse glad allen new wild not different

i really about it's really good old allen it's still smart insightful 
though either stale too cartoonish even allen still not exactly about as extremely about 
never close enough actual they're really happy on close enough lee
