sudden personal lately whole on just 
it's about tony as important not slightly ignorant social 
he's successfully interesting exciting even pretty smart never totally riveting as i too obsessed ever really satisfying too obsessed all ever totally smart 
civil inside nuclear over not appropriately scary all never totally overly brilliant 
 same way it's engrossing entire it's scary way man's decent it's too technical 
it's too cold not as fascinating exciting as 
better big leading because he's charming witty never uninteresting up not well enough really 
i last year's damn perfect michael as deeply flawed human cold off then as away 
not only exciting chilling also best entire 
not i year's spanish doesn't 
smith's frankly too perfect too perfect 
basically fine regardless 
he's as very good reasonably moral 
so generally doesn't real as human therefore boring about as much as black 
he's good dramatic just first half not isn't great whole here likable sympathetic real on real deep interesting 
as on outside lee 

as smith's as other out 
black seth green interesting because they're well fascinating they're evil doesn't as such almost 
like sole doesn't automatically as 
they're also scary because they're not fully aware on 
it's as they're obsessed not because they're evil because it's fun no else like 
unfortunately also on instead thus not as out because on 
sure you're you're not out on 
tony never ever 
he's because always interesting not occasionally moronic he's not great because he's too technical 
perfectly they're always sure you're 
incredibly annoying mechanical flashy never great still real 
never actually great it's never actually boring it's always intriguing 
endlessly fascinating about smith's likeable good worth 
best big annual woody allen up good old all so never actually over personal so smith's worth
