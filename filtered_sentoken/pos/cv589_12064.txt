robert specific genre on own 
west dirty long 
same true recent genre over last john 
there very little ever on 
there's no young o'donnell doesn't great 
instead grand legal southern gothic wildly eccentric black somewhat bleak even female 
central rick other 
rich never dirty even incessantly 
rick ugly rarely 
never isn't hard large 
he's late up on always it's because he's around 
hasn't lost rick 
because up together 
rick out slightly psychotic robert old other old 
actually rick always weird like 
as few short 
rick up convincing 
up private robert jr 
mental out 
there even ominous constant 
dark 
isn't it's 
almost all dark light 
great 
there enough rick almost all behind as literally 
just about genre epic 
no genre always sure usually all little often 
 no different much restrained here 
however little easily routine 
great film's especially rarely outside own 
here british consistently southern essentially interesting sympathetic 
rick extremely flawed real 
entire flat because so much on 
supporting also fine probably best known as jewish schindler's 
gruff comic robert on-screen just weird 
doesn't like much because very little closely film's entire few off either silly overbearing 
isn't like nonetheless solid genre successful somewhat 
like as commercial as only artistic tiny don't 
much better generic
