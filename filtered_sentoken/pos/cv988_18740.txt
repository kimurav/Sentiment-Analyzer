i i there new there isn't 
george special again 
first on big so much i original on video 
compelling about phantom not disposable amazing 
basically film's around 
qui-gon young obi-wan out animated 
down young 
qui-gon strongly immediately 

however about future unknown 
meanwhile frustrated young so much on 
there hardly emotional even behind frenzied whole down 
not phantom poorly brilliantly 
all human usually pure not uplifting 
fun phantom not 
moronic 

george fun as memorable as vain 
secondly good bad on movie's so different familiar previous 
due perhaps utter movie's visual here 
epic 
i much about acting though acting never anyway 
however there absolutely no straightforward stale 
great as stoic 
there 
only here evident 
inevitable there so much about 
final doesn't quite famous back climactic amazing fun own 

visual astonishing underwater short special 
not fifth there as visual as 
reminiscent fifth previous maybe even classic silent 
however all so original 
original even film's sheer even upcoming 
remarkable all over 
gigantic complete simple brown 
true 
as john i don't he's as complex powerful i even 
as epic as schindler's as as 
bare previous on much intense 
overwhelming high disappointed 
there very little it's very accomplished skillfully 
best fun best big-budget out definitely
