brief no 
haven't then up on haven't well i you're small 
first first all it's up 
well yes no 
it's good there's like about it's not 
i first titanic i last i ain't downright sick out such dreadful real-life 
i mean hollywood's entirely out new 
whatever next i about on jean 
i not entirely then i alone 
it's out well mostly obsessed i 
i didn't several about 
so i slightly open i still didn't i'd much 
i yes no 
mainly yes i'm happy 
first so beautifully not so much because i'll about later because stunning as principal so strong human 
stuart elderly modern 
 
well it's often effective though sometimes flat 
here 
doesn't all much 
stuart stunning 
much though relatively brief 
also impressive wholly above often poor 
it's old literal live touching 
i first half largely because such 
it's engaging touching very enjoyable 
there's as well simply because it's not happy 
second half 
all 
i'm sure forward eager because as he's real merely manipulative emotionally 
i as i far enjoyable 
titanic about 

don't second 
gratuitous well perhaps not today's i'm sure there's far other 
i certainly shocking graphic last so 
not i'd such vivid as 
overdone 
i so 
sometimes 
no no happy i didn't quite shocking powerful film's second half 
still overdone heavy-handed not because i i last 
really couldn't emotionally psychotic overboard desperately 
perhaps along on 
promising never particularly pretty powerful no fine on 
i however slightly uplifting past half 
so powerful last rather excessive 
haven't 
it's though beautifully that's 
as well titanic 
it's 
i very little so far as concerned 
really like 
back 
i 
like 
i 
such as i i now not just clumsy 
yes 
little not 

acting on fine strong 
stuart though didn't 
all titanic left right perhaps 
spectacular 
like i excessive well 
i haven't even beautiful 
utterly heavenly though bored 
 
finished longer i 
just worth all 
don't about 

though 
last as best all-time 
i don't so 
it's certainly powerful memorable ever i don't quite as all-time 
as they're reportedly titanic well i that's typical
