i left david lost i fellow i like just out through back through 
first second only on 
won't it's over though there certainly enough reasonable 
difficult because partly on 
i however on l fred clearly apparently inside asleep 
naturally enough little frightened confused doesn't robert fred on once hilarious 
next fred brutally 
inexplicably young 
fred notably again blonde otherwise 
i away little too much doesn't neat on cinematic lost out full 
lost sound like there weird 
on lost dark previous 
not around rather * * 
there deeply disturbing all bizarre here 
left out probably other 
all appropriately typically 
as often on sound on lost perfectly 
there on blank as down on haunting mortal technically yet present vivid just as effective as not so hysterical 
darkly nearly exactly 
well anyway i i bored as inherently interesting mostly viewer's because original 
main too intelligent sleazy otherwise pretty much blond couldn't fortunately as well as other typically such as strained awkward film's spooky 
typically graphic disturbing relevant also somewhat overdone here 
it's not exactly like almost else thoroughly weird creepy unlikely cheap as much as unnecessary frankly kind dumb off 
minor don't lost as unsettling recent 
down lost as such intense brilliantly effective
