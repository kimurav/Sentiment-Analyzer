awful 
desperately same 
apparently 
perhaps perfect still film's on 
good 
as william tiny english 
famous 
common stilted first highly 
later william so passionate 
 aside deadly accurate 
only 
richard all first romantic 
as constantly lead it's spoiled bored 
previously also smart enough unlikely not enough worth so around eccentric 
now dear probably about as 
yes he's not nearly as as appropriately naked lousy 
movie's best william around last on 
only as british 
fantastic like dull main dramatic 
especially appealing too many similar william ultimately only common they're lonely 
 worth i'm just not nearly so as best either ever 
nonetheless enjoyable on visual i especially playful 
only minor off on too hard up
