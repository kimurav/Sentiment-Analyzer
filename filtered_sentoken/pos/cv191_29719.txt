i i'm new romantic because also i current 
magic also very funny very romantic 
i not big romantic genre 
maybe underrated supporting hilarious 
maybe john such as high con 
maybe because i as as right now whole romantic currently 
simple 
john john ever so hot over henry middle 
together about down few local 
already other john on on 
just together future 
later on opposite john still unsure other out 
then enjoyable often hilarious such as john as new as crazed out right all 
fortunately first-time strong predictable corny narrative 
michael very unfunny very funny funny off genuine 
nice 
on such as even high quiet film's main 
it's left behind romantic john unsettling
