i'm not quite sure best about 
i i little disappointed political false i 
quite few i absolutely hilarious out loud whole way through didn't 
also vicious on way american political didn't quite either 
few even worthy 
political black definitely didn't 
actually very clever on shady political 
around political robert american public up sexually young 
probably as so isn't particularly relevant likely regardless 
along anne enough thus on 
as i not quite as hilarious as i there genuinely funny here such as familiar clich out over urban uplifting inspirational then right 
modern sound frightened young terrorist on 
consistently effective around fictional out 
william old woody out psycho 
not as on up new on 
still even little short believable 
regardless official wouldn't major eastern european there no on 
never american public apparent few on such as aforementioned 
apparently 
there also forced public thus far away 
doesn't quite as american up lead first 
never concerned rather about convincing not enough off 
dark as far willing secret 
meanwhile completely out just as creative 
not able fake ever 
i it's fair little public classic 
still american domestic very real 
further even real 
talented still consistently whatever
