open i 
i such near foolish i actually first tough baldwin steven 
good 
well just about as good as steven seagal confused no 
now i don't just i'm not too keen on so 80's now slowly 
i'm gritty like french 
along just about as often as george so true i like eager inevitably i over 
so about willing out tough actually like no 
i'm gritty dangerous like modern 
yes it's all very corny awfully i'm precisely 
as little up own joe's indian best gritty adolescent all thin moral psychological 
as adult haven't all sure i high emotional i still potentially 
now it's corrupt 
really all own 



so damn gritty undercover i way sarah michelle i completely utterly 
kind up brad currently 
i mere prior i as didn't 
 though recent like deep dead i probably quite few bad 
like eric currently direct video talented leading didn't 
 there direct video 
here not all al also 
danny down on gritty new 
much like 
apt as kinda forced corrupt 
entirely on low big sometimes 
danny though he's fairly good along way 
best way about internal then undercover as double 
so not on 
right away exactly he'll 
way great 
undercover almost exciting even kind out all like too deep 
not such risky 
all hard old as well as intense notably 
back up 
rapidly next rarely instead away precisely 
many especially oliver little too heavily on other presumably up 
isn't as much here as on recent nearly just 
though late several really awful maybe together recent completely unnecessary here on not dull 
i like best simplistic 
often easy even tolerable 
aren't popular anymore yes popular like extended just average so full unnecessary fat like boring no other isn't gay lame comic who's never funny on on 
all moral back out all really 
completely on all completely believable 
there's great early on as he's about corny inspirational instead down front 
never michael even though not damn out because too human weak 
very next danny out 
he's lost 
little 
maybe not sure 
epic it's nice little
