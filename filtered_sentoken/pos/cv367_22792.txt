sarah henry because well he's just normal 
it's all no 
on other madly sarah 
unfortunately up 
all serious so present 
it's few later still other so private ian sarah up too 
sound straight forward it's not 
it's deep dark ever lasting 
all sound like really 
great english patient only better definitely because out all i 
also well 
even though i didn't there's no just as 
so about 
all 
it's not typical all well complicated depressing

also confusing especially 
around past present so obviously awhile
