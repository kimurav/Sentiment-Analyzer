 deliciously right commendable thus far pretty uneven 
here's genuinely fun it's it's admittedly proud 
ford comedic lead movie's ford such dramatic it's easy funny 
as female anne also big on back sweet charismatic 
not way that's hard 
ford as gruff harris new 
on frank david nearby so reluctantly there 
terrible immediately deserted few on back 
unpleasant often hilarious little unlikely odd other 
meanwhile back frank female 
obviously few good early on eventually contrived far engrossing 
only minor 

slim never out welcome like as long as 
michael clever plenty notable favorite mean though essentially down they're all quite engaging 
even movie's serious 
over not private ellen heterosexual 
 so she's lesbian 
so 

doesn't here wrong big way 
ford really 
romantic ford old 
several wrong 

 still good 
 i still good ford 
she's good too together memorable
