apparently tony major new new american i don't not happy final nearly altogether 
about kind before much over 
as i american extremely good not just because tony subject because powerful charismatic edward norton 
it's hard only fantastic primal here now own 
norton american very best 
young danny edward beverly 
brutally black 
out through danny 
danny high eager 
much white 
now however up bad 
all interesting young not stupid intelligent articulate straightforward 
it's hard controversial not right 
because american there main only way sympathetic 
i partially because i not way it's interesting way loud obnoxious he's also very smart 
believable black 
it's clear he's passionate about he's not just up 
as talented as norton 
it's astonishing frightening norton on 
just right he's perfect whole norton all 
even he's likable that's about 
principal obsessed danny 
other all terrific 
visually very powerful 
interesting artistic nicely strange moody 
like lately american past last few 
climactic very pretentious brief 
so smart subtle up like such simplistic way 
exactly tony about final 
perhaps last 
it's hard not partially good so many weak american compelling way
